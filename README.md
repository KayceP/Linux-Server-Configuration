# Linux Server Configuration
My personal set of server configuration instructions for the  [Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/uconnect/intensive/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree) Linux Server Project, hosted on a Linode server running Ubuntu.

## Project Overview

For this project, we were tasked with taking a baseline installation of a Linux distribution and preparing it to host a previous web application we built, the [Item Catalog Project](https://github.com/KayceP/OMenu). 

This included installing updates, securing it from a number of attack vectors and installing/configuring web and database servers.

Our reviewer was issued a login with root access, and had to log into our server and validate our work, and tested the server/web application for functonality and security.

While not meant for anyone to test beyond our reviewer, the full project details will be documented below.

This project utilizes:

- Linode (Virtual Private Server)
- Ubuntu (16.04 LTS)
  - A
  - B
  - C
  - D
  - E

## User Requirements

- Access to a server running Linux, perferably Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
- Shell access to the server, including root.


## Running
